## Notes

- Snake class will have functions to get coordinates (GetX and GetY) that return the location of the object
- Use random number, generate # between -1 and 1 for x and y coordinates  
  - Check GetX and GetY functions to see if coordinates are not touching snake
    - If it is, get new coordinates. If not, place
  - This will determine the location of the apple
